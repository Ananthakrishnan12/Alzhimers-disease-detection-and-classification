# ALZHIMERS DISEASE DETECTION & CLASSIFICATION:
# ABSTRACT: 
<!-- The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) plays an important role in patient treatment, especially at the disease’s early stages, because risk awareness allows the patients to undergo preventive measures even before the occurrence of irreversible brain damage. Although many recent studies have used computers to diagnose AD, most machine detection methods are limited by congenital observations. AD can be diagnosed-but not predicted-at its early stages, as prediction is only applicable before the disease manifests itself.Deep Learning (DL) has become a common technique for the early diagnosis of AD. Here, we briefly
review some of the important literature on AD and explore how DL can help researchers diagnose the disease
at its early stages. -->
